Welcome to POLLUX's technical user manual!
==============================================

.. note::

   This project is under active development.


This is the main landing page for the technical user manual of the TNO POLLUX digital twin framework for Power to X assets. As the name implies, the technical user manual is aimed at users of the POLLUX framework with a technical understanding of P2X systems, such as operators and engineers. The manual gives an overview on the structure of the POLLUX platform (:numref:`about-pollux`), an introduction to getting started with the platform (:numref:`getting-started`), and a guide to setting up project. In addition, each individual application or module will have its own step-by-step manual instructing a user on how to use it (:numref:`applications-section` respectively). Finally, the glossary (:numref:`pollux-glossary`) gives the definitions of all key terms used throughout this manual and in the platform itself.
