About POLLUX
==============================================

POLLUX is a digital twin for Power to X systems in development by TNO since 2022. Its core consists of a monitoring and modelling framework with API's (Application Programming Interface) for interfacing with a database streaming continuous real-time production data coming from Power to Hydrogen assets; from a wind turbine or solar pv, to electrolyzer and hydrogen storage. Also for Power to Heat assets (heatpump, heat storage). The framework allows not only for the monitoring of raw production data, but also the calculation and visualization of key performance indicators. In addition, the modelling functionalities within the system enable the user to calibrate physical model based on process data, calculate process values at points where no sensors are present, and optimize the system's operating conditions for specific KPIs, suggesting actions to take to improve the P2X's performance.

In this page you can find the links to all pages that give a general overview to the POLLUX architecture, and open-source strategy.
